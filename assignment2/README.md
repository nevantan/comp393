# Assignment 2: 3D Noise

## Requirements

1. Based on the codes discussed in Section 6.3 of Unit 6, write three routines:

* 3D noise
* 3D smooth noise
* 3D interpolate noise

2. Apply the texture on a cube.

## Implementation Notes

The entire assignment has been implemented in the shaders as it ended up being
faster and easier to do everything there. The third dimension of the noise function
is tied to the cursor position in the test program.
