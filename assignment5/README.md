# Assignment 5 Notes

## Shader class

The Shader class has been updated to link the shader program in the constructor rather than
in the `Program()` method as before. It also has the capability to access uniform variables
by name from a map, adding the id to said map if it is not already present. Aside from these
modifications, the Shader class is the same as previous assignments.
